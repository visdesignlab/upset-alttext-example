# Stimuli for Interview Study for UpSet Text Descriptions. 

This repository contains the stimuli used in an interview study with Blind and Low-Vision Users to evaluate text descriptisons for UpSet plots. 

The stimuli are simple, structured HTML pages intended to be read with a screen reader. The pages are deployed at https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/upset-alttext-example/. 

The Text Descriptions are generated with our generator available at https://github.com/visdesignlab/upset-alt-txt-gen
